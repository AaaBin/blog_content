summary: A method to control browser programmatically
---
Last week, I received a task about capturing a screenshot of a web page in our backend server. My first thought was: “it sounds possible but might be difficult”. To capture a screenshot, you need to load an HTML and render it with CSS. After a simple 3-minutes search, I found several approaches already exist. These are called headless browsers.

Headless browser is a kind of web browser without GUI. It can be controlled programmatically. Like entering a site or capturing a screenshot.
