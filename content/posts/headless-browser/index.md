summary: a approach to control browser programmatically
---
Last week, I got a requirement about capturing a screenshot	 of a web page in our backend server. My first thought is: “it sounds possible but might be difficult”. Because to capture a screenshot means you need to to load html file and render it with css. But after a simple 3 minutes search. I found there are several approaches already exist. Called headless browser.

Headless browser is a kind of web browser without GUI. It can be controlled programmatically. Like entering a site or capture a screenshot.
